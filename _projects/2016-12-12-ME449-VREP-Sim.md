## Overview

##### Consists of various assignments for ME 449: Robotic Manipulation

Below are several videos of simulations of various assignments from ME 449. The concepts learned from this course, including inverse kinematics and mobile base robot manipulation, were used to create these simulations.

The in-class software package used in this class can be found [here].

My code for the below simulation videos can be found at [this] github repo.
