## My Portfolio
Welcome to my MSR Portfolio! Located in this portfolio are projects that I have completed or been a part of during my undergraduate career at UCSD and time as a Master's student at Northwestern University. My most up-to-date resume can also be found at the [Resume] tab found on this site.

## About Myself
My name is Elton Cheng and I am currently a student in the Master of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern University. I received my Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering from the University of California, San Diego.

### Research interests
* Medical robotics (IE: exoskeletons, robotic prosthesis)
* Applications between virtual reality and robotics
* Just learning about everything robotics!

If you have any questions about my work or about my time in the MSR program at Northwestern, feel free to [contact] me.

This portfolio is still under development, so please pardon me if there are any issues viewing my portfolio.
